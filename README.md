# Document Database
## Author: Ibrahim Alhamshari


> In this project it was required from us to *build a document database* to store the data to it as a JSON objects and this database must be very similar to the databases that work as a JSON store to the data like MongoDB.   

> A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. These data can be expanded, updated, deleted, and retrieved rapidly for various uses.

> The application is a command-line program, where the arguments are passed to the program at run-time. 
The arguments are the information that we pass after typing to the program. These arguments will be sent and received between the client and the server by using bufferedWriter and bufferedReader.

> In the program, the connection between the client and the server are implemented by using **Computer networking (Sockets)**. In the networking, sockets are the endpoints of logical connections between two hosts and can be used to send and receive data.

> For sending and receiving messages between the client and the server I implemented the **Multi-threading** technique where I used threads that work concurrency, one will be listening for the messages from the server and other for sending the messages to the server.
